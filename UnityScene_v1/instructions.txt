Here's a usecase for physical UI/buttons/sliders. It's a DJ controller with
effects buttons, play buttons, crossfader, volume slider, and two
turntables that let you touch and seek forwards/backwards.

The vertical slider in the middle is the master volume.
The horizontal slider near the bottom is the crossfader.

There are three buttons on each side, the one closest to the crossfader
is the play/pause button. The other two buttons are effects buttons: a 
high pass filter and a low pass filter.

Each turntable object owns what track its playing and which buttons are used
to enable/disable certain filters/effects.

You can also use the mouse to adjust the camera angle to whatever is 
most comfortable.
